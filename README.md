## Contribution

Feel free to report any issues and participate in discussions.
Please keep in mind the following rules when it comes to contribution:

### No direct commits to the main/master branch

We work with feature branches, which means whenever you work on a feature or bug you do that on the explicit branch. If the feature is ready, we **merge it with a pull-request** into the main/master branch. In some cases, the app team can bypass that rule if deemed necessary. 

### No pull-request merge without another persons approval

Always request a review of at least one person before merging the feature.
