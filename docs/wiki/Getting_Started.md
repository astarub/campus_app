This pages will explain how to setup your development environment and first steps to start contributing to our project.

## Install Flutter

First you need to install Flutter. The [official flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) provides a handy tutorial about Flutter installation.

## Setup an editor and emulator

To write code you need an editor or IDE (obvously :D ). Wer would recommend to follow
the official steps for VS Code by the [official flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode).

In addition of the VS Code setup you need a running phone emulator. The best case, for non-MAC-users, is to install Android Studio Code and the included Virtual Device Manager.
The [android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) provide a useful tutorial about AVD creation and management. We would recommend to create a phone with the newest Android API Level or at least API level 30 (Android 11.0). Google Play support is optional.

## Clone repository

If you work the first time with git, check out this [cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/).

You can easily clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/astarub/campus_app`. Git will create a new folder for you inside your current directory.

Now you can open VS Code with the command `code ./campus_app` and start development.

## Start development

After opening VS Code you should open a terminal and update all flutter dependencies. For this, run the following command: `flutter pub get`.

Meanwhile you can start your emulator created privously. For that you can run: `flutter emulator --launch <emulator_name>`. 

In the end execute `flutter run` to start the app. Now, evertime you updated the source you can use the key `r` or `R` to update the running app.
You can quite quit `q`.

Happy coding. :)
