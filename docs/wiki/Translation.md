All translation files are located inside the `assets/l10n/`-folder and use the basic
[ARB-syntax](https://localizely.com/flutter-arb/). The file `l10n.yaml` defines some general configuration to provide multi-language support.

## Open-Call for Translator

If you don't mind to handle JSON-like text documents, than feel free to add a translation
to our project. It's pretty simple:

1. Copy & Paste the file `l10n_en.arb` and rename it to your language code. For example: `l10n_de.arb`.
2. Open it with an text editor of your choice.
3. At each line you will see the following syntax: `"a String": "another String",`. Do not touch the first String! Replace the second String with your translation.
4. If you know how to commit to our repository, than feel free to create a pull request. Otherwise you can send your translated file to `dev@asta-bochum.de`.

THANKS! :D
