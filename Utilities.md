In comparison to the standard HTTP client, Dio provides a lot of handy features such
as automatic Cookie- and Session-Management. That makes our life easier. At the beginning
of development just the standard HTTP client was used and caused problems. That the reason
why we switched to Dio.

The Dio client is initialized inside the injection Container located inside `lib/core/injection.dart`. The `DioUtils` class takes the Dio client a `CookieJar` to initialize
both correctly and DISABLE CERTIFICATE VALIDATION. For security reasons, this has to be
fixed before we release the first version. But in some scenarios we recognized abnormal  behavior of some RUB servers. So future research is needed!
